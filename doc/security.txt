Security/Compliance Checklist                                         *security*
================================================================================

1. Security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SSRF protections (see fetch.txt)
- robots.txt respect (see fetch.txt)
- sanitize URLs in logs (no leaking tokens)
- cap bytes + timeouts everywhere
- limit concurrency and parallelism
- disable rendered mode unless explicitly enabled

2. Content rights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Store only what you need:
  - extracted text/markdown is usually enough
  - avoid storing full raw HTML unless required
Brave notes they provide ranked public URLs/snippets; content rights remain with
publishers—your access must comply with publisher terms.
